A JavaScript translation of the timesince function from Django/Python.

timesince() converts Date objects to a human readable format which is a delta from
the current time.  Here is an example: '2 months, 3 days'.

Put this snippet in an HTML page for an example of use:

<script src="timesince.js"></script>
<script>
  var now = new Date();
  var d = new Date(now.getTime() - 3 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  alert(d.timesince());
</script>
